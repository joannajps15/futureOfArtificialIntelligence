   <h2>Issues With Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    
    <p>
      Currently, artificial intelligence does not reach the scope of human intelligence. However, through further research and development it may reach or expand beyond the scope of human intelligence. Many of the issues and controversey in relation to artificial intelligence stem from this aspect of artificial intelligence. 
    </p>

    <p>This and other controversies related to the development of AI are exemplified in the following article: <a href = "https://blog.proto.io/controversy-artificial-intelligence/">The Controversy of Artificial Intelligence</a></p>

    <h4>Controversy Over Types of AI</h4>
    <blockquote>“Those robot rebellion scenarios are usually about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Garden variety AI is designed to solve specific problems, like driving a car, or detecting cancer. Artificial general intelligence is bigger — it refers to an AI that’s capable of reasoning and thinking like a person. An AGI wouldn’t necessarily have to be conscious, but it would be able to do things like a human would. That could mean using language well enough to convince a human speaker it is human (The Turing Test), going into an average home and making coffee (The Coffee Test — proposed by Apple cofounder and AI “opponent” Steve Wozniak) or even enrolling and passing a class (The Robot College Student Test).

Artificial General Intelligence is the one that people like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk worry could replace us with another conscious species.”</blockquote>


    <h4>Controversy Over Control</h4>
    <blockquote>“Artificial intelligence is a powerful technology, which can make humans much more effective at a wide range of tasks. One concern groups like OpenAI have is that that power will be concentrated in too few hands or the wrong hands, enabling totalitarian governments, malevolent corporations, terrorists or other bad actors to do various destructive things, up to, and including starting World War III. An open source approach evens things out, by making sure no one group is able to monopolize this technology.”</blockquote>

    <h4>Controversy Over Use of AI</h4>
    <blockquote>“Another concern that open source doesn’t answer is economic disruption. As technology develops and becomes more efficient, it reduces the amount of labor that’s needed, meaning fewer jobs. As robots and AI get more powerful, that process is going to accelerate. What happens to all those unemployed people? How do we make sure they have a reasonable standard of living and a place in society? And what should the ultimate goal be? As AI handles more and more of the work, can and should we sustain an economic model based on competition, or do we have to evolve to a more cooperative model?”
</blockquote>

  <h4>Bias in AI</h4>
  
    <p>In addition to the controversy referenced in the prior article, this article makes a good claim regarding the intrinsic bias within AI: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-bias.html">Dealing with Bias in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>

    <p>The article brings addresses how human-bias can significantly affect AI. It addresses how data, algorithms, and humans can introduce their own biases into Artificial Intelligence. </p>

<p>Fortunately, effort is being put forth to address these biases in artificial intelligence development: </p>
  
  <blockquote>"The ImageNet data set was curated in 2009 for object recognition, containing more
than 14 million images. There are several things we are doing with an eye toward rebalancing this data set to better reflect the world at
large. So far, we went through 2,200 categories to remove those that may be considered offensive. We’re working on designing an interface
to let the community flag additional categories or images as offensive, allowing everyone to have a voice in this system. We are also
working to understand the impact that such changes would have on the downstream computer vision models and algorithms."</blockquote>

  
  <h2>Intent with Artificial Intelligence</h2>

  <img src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2020/01/AI-Genie_3K_Lede.jpg" alt="Powerful artificial intelligence is like the proverbial genie in a bottle. A seemingly innocent wish — “make my home eco-friendly” — can lead to unintended consequences." width="1200"></img>
  
  <p>Having addressed various topics of controversy within the topic of AI development, it is critical to also address the very intent or purpose of this development. It is important to distinguish between whether the AI technology will truly be fruitful and work inline with our intentions, and for the true betterment of humanity.</p>

  <p>The article, <a href = "https://www.quantamagazine.org/artificial-intelligence-will-do-what-we-ask-thats-a-problem-20200130/">Artificial Intelligence Will Do What We Ask. That's a Problem.</a> addresses how implementing artificial intelligence may not exactly work as per our intentions. The author, Natalie Wolchover discusses this issue in reference to the AI based recommendations algorithm YouTube uses: </p>

  <blockquote>"YouTube’s algorithm has been helping to polarize and radicalize people and spread misinformation, just to keep us watching...YouTube’s engineers probably didn’t intend to radicalize humanity. But coders can’t possibly think of everything. “The current way we do AI puts a lot of burden on the designers to understand what the consequences of the incentives they give their systems are,” said Hadfield-Menell. “And one of the things we’re learning is that a lot of engineers have made mistakes.” "</blockquote>

  <p>In turn, the author brings up the ideas and research of Stuart Russel: </p>

  <blockquote>"Instead of machines pursuing goals of their own, the new thinking goes, they should seek to satisfy human preferences; their only goal should be to learn more about what our preferences are"</blockquote>

  <p>This idea of ensuring machines don't act solely for the purpose of achieving a certain goal, but rather to act inline with the goals of human beings will enable less biased and more performative/fruitful AI technology.</p>
  
  <h2>AI Applications</h2>
  
  <p>Having addressed issues, and potential solutions related to artificial intelligence, one other aspect to be addressed is the actual implementation of AI.</p>

  <p>Artificial Intelligence is a type of technology that (currently) performs repetitive tasks. However, humans on the other side have a wider skillset ranging from hard to soft skills. These soft skills, in particular, differentiate us from the modern understanding and applications of technology.</p>

  <p>The following article: <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/artificial-intelligence-will-change-think-leadership/">Artificial Intelligence Will Change How We Think About Leadership</a> addresses the idea of using soft skills and good leadership to coordinate Artificial Intelligence development effectively. </p>

  <p>This article, based on a podcast with David De Cremer, author of "Leadership by Algorithm: Who Leads and Who Follows in the AI Era?" reflects on the impact of AI within manegerial and leadership schemes. De Cremer states: </p>

  <blockquote>The job of the future may well be [that of] a philosopher who understands technology, what it means to our human identity, and what it means for the kind of society we would like to see</blockquote>
  
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>Overall, based on the articles, it is certain that it is crucial to analyze implementation, intent, and controversies when trying to develop and research AI.</p>

  <p>However, it is not of my accord to convince you what is right or wrong within the context of this situation. Rather, this is an accumulation of relevent data that bring up convincing points regarding the development and future usage of AI. These sources emphasize how relevent of a topic Artificial Intelligence is, and how significant it's impacts will be.</p>

  <p>Above all, this analysis of perspectives is so critical. We need to be vigilant of AI and it's overall impacts in society as we continue to develop on a socioeconomic and technological basis.</p>
