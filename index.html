    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is indefinitely a vast topic. Given recent developments in technology, it is crucial that more emphasis and thought is put towards the future of artificial intelligence.

    <h2>Defining Artificial Intelligence</h2>

    <h4><em>Prior to introducing perspectives, it is critical that a definition is established around artificial intelligence to bring about insightful and accurate discussion.</em></h4>
    
    <h3>Differentiating AI from Autonomous Functions in Modern Technology</h3>
    
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is more often than not confused with autonomous technology. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Autonomous Technology</strong></p>
    
    <p>
      Autonomous Technology relates to technology that is able to follow and execute a specific set of instructions. For example, despite that computers may seem 'intelligent' due to the various functions it can compute, it is not artificially intelligent. It simply follows instructions in the form of binary code. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
    
    <p> 
      Artificial Intelligence is different as it relates to technology that is capable of replicating human intelligence.
